# 7. Backend architecture

Implements §6 under the constraints of §2. Every non-obvious choice is tied to
the requirement that forces it.

```

**Postgres is the only infrastructure dependency.** No Redis, no message broker.
Leases, the rollup state and the notification outbox all live in the same
database, which means one transaction boundary, one backup, and `docker compose
up` satisfies NFR-16 with three containers.

Redis would buy faster counters and pub/sub. It would also add a second source
of truth for scheduling state, and the loss of transactional coupling between
"probe recorded" and "aggregate updated" — the exact coupling NFR-3 depends on.
Recorded as an ADR with that reasoning.

**api** serves the REST API and owns all user-facing reads and writes. It never
probes.

**worker** is the same NestJS codebase started with a different entrypoint and
module set. Run `N` of them; they coordinate only through Postgres. Four loops:

| Loop | Period | Job |
|---|---|---|
| scheduler | 1 s | claim due endpoints, execute probes, record results |
| rollup | 10 s | fold new results into aggregates |
| evaluator | 10 s | open/close incidents, detect `UNKNOWN`, enqueue notifications |
| dispatcher | 5 s | drain the notification outbox |

Separating them means a stuck SMTP server cannot delay probing — a variant of
NFR-1 applied to the system's own internals.

## 7.2 The path of one probe

```
1. scheduler   claim endpoints WHERE next_run_at <= now()   [SKIP LOCKED]
2. scheduler   next_run_at = scheduled_at + interval        (before probing)
3. prober      resolve DNS → validate every IP → pin → request
4. prober      capture phase boundaries, status, body (bounded)
5. prober      evaluate assertions → success/failure + class
6. worker      INSERT probe_result
7. rollup      upsert 1m / 1h / 1d aggregate buckets        [atomic SQL]
8. evaluator   consecutive counters → state → incident open/close
9. evaluator   INSERT notification_outbox
10. dispatcher send email, mark delivered or retry
```

Step 2 before step 3 is deliberate: the next slot is computed from the
*scheduled* time, not from completion, so a slow probe delays one cycle instead
of shifting every future one (NFR-2).

## 7.3 Scheduling

### The claim

```sql
WITH due AS (
  SELECT endpoint_id
  FROM   endpoint_runtime
  WHERE  enabled
    AND  next_run_at <= now()
    AND  (leased_until IS NULL OR leased_until < now())
  ORDER  BY next_run_at
  FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
  LIMIT  $batch
)
UPDATE endpoint_runtime r
SET    leased_until = now() + $lease,
       leased_by    = $worker_id,
       scheduled_at = r.next_run_at,
       next_run_at  = r.next_run_at + make_interval(secs => r.interval_s)
FROM   due
WHERE  r.endpoint_id = due.endpoint_id
RETURNING r.*;
```

| Clause | Requirement |
|---|---|
| `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` | NFR-3 — workers get disjoint batches, nobody blocks |
| `leased_until < now()` | NFR-4 — a dead worker's claim is reclaimable after the lease expires |
| `next_run_at + interval` | NFR-2 — drift cannot accumulate; it is computed from the schedule, not the clock |
| no per-worker configuration | NFR-7 — scale by starting another process |

**Catch-up guard.** If a worker was down for an hour, `next_run_at + interval`
is still in the past and the endpoint would be probed 60 times in a burst. When
`next_run_at` falls more than one interval behind, it is snapped forward to the
next future slot and the skipped span is recorded as `UNKNOWN` (§3.5.2) rather
than back-filled with fiction.

`endpoint_runtime` is a **separate narrow table** from `endpoints`. Scheduling
columns are written on every probe; configuration columns almost never are.
Splitting them keeps the hot row small, keeps HOT updates on one index, and
stops autovacuum churn on the config table.

### Concurrency

Each worker runs probes on a bounded concurrency pool (default 50). A hung
endpoint occupies one slot bounded by its own timeout, never the loop (NFR-1).
The lease must exceed `timeout + slack`, or a slow probe's own lease expires
mid-flight and a second worker duplicates it.

## 7.4 The probe executor

A pure function, per the blackbox_exporter lesson (§4.5):

```ts
probe(config: EndpointProbeConfig, deps: { resolver; clock; dispatcherFactory })
  : Promise<ProbeOutcome>
```

No database, no scheduler, no global state. Fully testable against a local HTTP
server that can be made to hang, reset, return bad TLS, or answer slowly.

**Timing.** Absolute phase boundaries via undici `diagnostics_channel` and
socket events (§3.3.1), never durations. `total_ms` measured directly, never
summed.

**Body handling.** Read at most `MAX_BODY_BYTES` (default 64 KB), used for
assertions, never persisted in full (NFR-13). Only assertion outcomes and a
truncated excerpt on failure are stored.

**Failure classification.** Node error codes map to the §3.4 taxonomy in one
table. Unmapped codes become `UNKNOWN_ERROR` with the raw code retained — never
silently coerced to a generic failure.

### SSRF guard (NFR-11)

Not URL validation. Four steps, all required:

1. Reject non-`http(s)` schemes, credentials in the URL, and non-standard ports
   outside the allowed set.
2. Resolve the hostname ourselves, collecting **every** A/AAAA answer.
3. Check each against a `node:net` `BlockList` — loopback, private, link-local,
   CGNAT, multicast, reserved, `169.254.169.254`, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 forms
   (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`). Any hit fails the whole probe.
4. **Pin the connection** to a validated IP with a custom undici dispatcher, so
   the socket cannot reach an address that was never checked. This closes the
   DNS-rebinding window between step 2 and connect (§4.8).

Re-run steps 2–4 on every redirect hop. A blocked probe records
`BLOCKED_BY_POLICY`, which is `UNKNOWN`, not `DOWN` — the guard must never
manufacture an outage.

## 7.5 Data model

```
users ──▶ services ──▶ endpoints ──▶ endpoint_runtime   (1:1, hot)
                           │
                           ├──▶ probe_results     (partitioned by day)
                           ├──▶ probe_stats       (1m / 1h / 1d buckets)
                           └──▶ incidents ──▶ notification_outbox

tags ──▶ service_tags, endpoint_tags
maintenance_windows ──▶ service | endpoint
slos ──▶ service | endpoint
```

### probe_results — raw, partitioned

```sql
CREATE TABLE probe_results (
    endpoint_id   uuid        NOT NULL,
    started_at    timestamptz NOT NULL,
    outcome       probe_outcome NOT NULL,      -- up | down | degraded | unknown
    failure_class failure_class,               -- §3.4, null on success
    status_code   smallint,
    total_ms      integer,
    dns_ms        integer,
    connect_ms    integer,
    tls_ms        integer,
    ttfb_ms       integer,
    transfer_ms   integer,
    assertions    jsonb,                       -- per-assertion results (§4.4)
    error_message text,
    cert_expires_at timestamptz,
    worker_id     text,
    PRIMARY KEY (endpoint_id, started_at)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (started_at);
```

Daily partitions. Retention is `DROP PARTITION` — O(1), no vacuum, no bloat.
This is the direct fix for the third Uptime Kuma defect in §4.2, where retention
runs two `DELETE` statements on the hot path of every probe.

### probe_stats — the aggregates that serve every chart

```sql
CREATE TABLE probe_stats (
    endpoint_id  uuid        NOT NULL,
    granularity  stat_grain  NOT NULL,          -- m1 | h1 | d1
    bucket_start timestamptz NOT NULL,
    count_up          integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    count_down        integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    count_degraded    integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    count_unknown     integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    count_maintenance integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    covered_seconds   integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   -- time-weighted uptime (§3.5.1)
    sum_total_ms      bigint  NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    min_total_ms      integer,
    max_total_ms      integer,
    sum_ttfb_ms       bigint  NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    hist_total        integer[] NOT NULL DEFAULT array_fill(0, ARRAY[20]),
    PRIMARY KEY (endpoint_id, granularity, bucket_start)
);
```

Histogram edges, fixed and documented (ms):
`10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 5000,
7500, 10000, 15000, 30000, ∞`

p95 is linear interpolation inside the containing bucket. Buckets merge by
integer addition, so minute → hour → day rollup is associative and exact
(§3.6). The same array renders as the latency heatmap.

Both count- and time-weighted uptime are derivable, because both
`count_*` and `covered_seconds` are stored — §3.5.1's comparison becomes a query,
not a redesign.

### The rollup must be atomic

The second Uptime Kuma defect (§4.2) is read-modify-write in application code.
probeboard increments inside the database:

```sql
INSERT INTO probe_stats AS s (endpoint_id, granularity, bucket_start,
                              count_up, covered_seconds, sum_total_ms,
                              min_total_ms, max_total_ms, hist_total)
VALUES ($1, 'm1', date_trunc('minute', $2), 1, $3, $4, $4, $4,
        array_fill(0, ARRAY[20]))
ON CONFLICT (endpoint_id, granularity, bucket_start) DO UPDATE SET
    count_up        = s.count_up        + 1,
    covered_seconds = s.covered_seconds + EXCLUDED.covered_seconds,
    sum_total_ms    = s.sum_total_ms    + EXCLUDED.sum_total_ms,
    min_total_ms    = least(s.min_total_ms, EXCLUDED.min_total_ms),
    max_total_ms    = greatest(s.max_total_ms, EXCLUDED.max_total_ms),
    hist_total[$5]  = s.hist_total[$5] + 1;
```

No row is ever read into a worker and written back, so concurrent workers cannot
lose an update (review rule g15).

### Idempotency

The rollup is driven off a watermark per endpoint, and every probe result has a
natural key `(endpoint_id, started_at)`. A retried rollup batch re-reads the
same rows; the watermark advances only on commit, in the same transaction as the
upserts. Re-running a batch is therefore safe but not free — so the watermark
and upserts share one transaction, making the whole step exactly-once in effect
(review rule g13).

### endpoint_runtime

```sql
CREATE TABLE endpoint_runtime (
    endpoint_id           uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    enabled               boolean     NOT NULL,
    interval_s            integer     NOT NULL,
    next_run_at           timestamptz NOT NULL,
    scheduled_at          timestamptz,
    leased_until          timestamptz,
    leased_by             text,
    state                 endpoint_state NOT NULL,     -- §3.7
    consecutive_failures  smallint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    consecutive_successes smallint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_probe_at         timestamptz,
    last_success_at       timestamptz
);
CREATE INDEX ON endpoint_runtime (next_run_at) WHERE enabled;
```

The partial index is what makes the claim query cheap at 500+ endpoints.

## 7.6 Incident evaluation

Runs in the evaluator loop, not in the prober, so notification logic cannot
slow down probing.

```
on probe result:
  failure → consecutive_failures++, consecutive_successes = 0
  success → consecutive_successes++, consecutive_failures = 0

  state UP|DEGRADED and failures == 1            → PENDING
  state PENDING and failures >= threshold_open   → DOWN, open incident
  state DOWN and successes >= threshold_close    → UP, close incident
  success and total_ms > latency_warn_ms         → DEGRADED
```

`opened_at` is the timestamp of the **first** failed probe of the run, not the
one that crossed the threshold (§3.8); `confirmed_at` records the crossing, so
detection latency is measurable. Symmetrically for `closed_at`.

**`UNKNOWN` detection** is a separate sweep: any enabled endpoint whose
`last_probe_at` is older than `2 × interval + grace` is marked `UNKNOWN`. This
is the only mechanism that notices probeboard itself failing.

**Maintenance** is checked before any state transition. Inside a window, results
are recorded and counted as `count_maintenance`, no incident opens, no email is
sent.

## 7.7 Notifications

A transactional **outbox**, not a direct send:

```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_outbox (
    id            uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id       uuid NOT NULL,
    service_id    uuid NOT NULL,
    kind          notification_kind NOT NULL,   -- incident_open | incident_close | cert_expiry | slo_burn
    group_key     text NOT NULL,                -- service + kind + window
    payload       jsonb NOT NULL,
    not_before    timestamptz NOT NULL,         -- grouping delay
    attempts      smallint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    delivered_at  timestamptz,
    last_error    text,
    UNIQUE (group_key)
);
```

The row is written **in the same transaction that opens the incident**. Either
both commit or neither does — an incident can never exist without its
notification, and a notification can never exist for an incident that was rolled
back (review rule g14).

| PRD rule | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| E-3 one email per service | `UNIQUE (group_key)`; `not_before = now() + 60s` collects siblings before the dispatcher picks it up |
| E-4 no spam | `incidents.last_notified_at` + decaying schedule 30 m / 2 h / 6 h / daily |
| E-8 never silently dropped | `attempts` with exponential backoff; permanent failure sets `last_error` and surfaces in the UI — the failure is never swallowed (review rule g2) |

Email is rendered server-side; SMTP configuration is environment-only, never in
source (review rule g10).

## 7.8 API surface

```
POST   /auth/register            POST /auth/login          POST /auth/logout
POST   /auth/verify-email        POST /auth/password

GET    /services                 POST /services
GET    /services/:id             PATCH /services/:id       DELETE /services/:id
GET    /services/:id/health

POST   /services/:id/endpoints
GET    /endpoints/:id            PATCH /endpoints/:id      DELETE /endpoints/:id
POST   /endpoints/:id/pause      POST /endpoints/:id/resume
POST   /endpoints/:id/check-now

GET    /endpoints/:id/results?from&to&limit
GET    /endpoints/:id/stats?from&to&granularity
GET    /endpoints/:id/uptime?window
GET    /endpoints/:id/incidents
GET    /incidents?status

GET    /tags                     POST /maintenance-windows
GET    /slos                     POST /slos
GET    /healthz                  GET  /metrics
```

**Contract rules.** Every list endpoint is paginated with a cursor and a bounded
`limit`. `/stats` picks granularity from the requested span and refuses spans
that would require raw rows (NFR-9). Every input is validated at the boundary
with a schema, including URL and header shape (review rule g12). Errors return a
stable machine-readable `code`, never a stack trace.

## 7.9 Module layout — `probeboard-api`

```
src/
  main.ts                 api entrypoint
  worker.ts               worker entrypoint
  common/                 config, logging, errors, pagination, crypto
  auth/                   register, login, sessions, password hashing

    failure-classes.ts
  scheduler/              claim loop, lease, catch-up

  stats/                  uptime, percentiles from histograms, SLO math
  metrics/                Prometheus exposition
```

`probing/` depends on nothing else in the tree — that is what keeps it a pure
function and what makes the security tests easy to write.

## 7.10 Testing

| Level | Covers | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| unit | assertions, failure mapping, percentile interpolation, histogram merge, state machine, burn rate | pure functions, no I/O |
| integration | probe executor against a local server that hangs, resets, serves bad TLS, redirects to `127.0.0.1` | real sockets, no internet |
| integration | claim query with N concurrent workers | real Postgres, no mocks |
| system | §2.3 criteria: load, fault injection, SSRF, retention | these produce the evaluation chapter |

No focused or skipped tests reach a commit (review rule g19); every bug fix
lands with the test that fails without it (g18).

## 7.11 Decisions to record as ADRs

| # | Decision | Alternatives rejected |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Postgres only, no Redis | Redis for leases/queue — second source of truth, loses transactional coupling |
| 2 | Hand-rolled `SKIP LOCKED` leases | pg-boss, BullMQ, `@nestjs/schedule` — the last is broken by construction for multi-instance |
| 3 | Fixed histogram buckets | t-digest/DDSketch, raw retention |
| 4 | Absolute phase boundaries | per-phase durations — breaks on redirects |
| 5 | Structured versioned assertions | Gatus-style string DSL — kept as optional sugar |
| 6 | Worker in the same codebase, separate entrypoint | separate repo, or probing inside the API process |
| 7 | Daily partitions + `DROP` | `DELETE`-based retention |
| 8 | Transactional outbox for email | direct send from the evaluator |
